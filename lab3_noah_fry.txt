During the course of the lab, the hardest part was understanding where to find relevant information. The lab is written pretty straightforward, 
though it was necessary that I read the xv6 literature in order to understand what was happening fully. My group partner and I talked about each problem
and when either of us got stuck we were able to help eachother. The lab was split 50 pts/50 pts.
